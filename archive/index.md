# Archive of rhythm game charts

This is an archive of my rhythm game charts. Most of these are links to
the official uploading site, although some would be hosted here as
no such site exists for the game (e.g. BMS/Lunatic Rave 2/beatoraja,
Stepmania) or when I do not want to upload the chart under question.

## osu!mania

### Gyudon (BMS-styled 7K, 7K+1)

- [無人区-Vacuum Track#ADD8E6-](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1151089)
  My first serious rank project. 7K+1 is done first completely on my own,
  with a 4K set added later due to input from a modder.
- [Sweet* Witch* Girl*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1401516)
  Same style as the last one, this time without scratch.

### Ramen (Typical 7K)

- [MilK](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1443095) (WIP)
An experiment with LNs and an attempt to go outside my comfort zone.

### 4K

- [Halcyon](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1102270) (abandoned)
  My first upload on osu!. Being a piece of sh*t, it ended up gaining
  over a thousand plays for some reason&hellip;
- [The Last Page](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1272833)
- [777](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1312841) (abandoned)
  Made by stealing ideas from 666 of SDVX, ending up containing a large
  vibro section that makes it unrankable.
- [Serendipity](osu/serendipity_osu_aninande.osu) (unuploaded)
  Made for [osu!mania 4K Otaku TV Size contest #2][ots2]. Didn't end
  up good.
