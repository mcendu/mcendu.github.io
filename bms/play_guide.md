Setup Guide and Useful Links for Playing BMS
============================================

## Clients

BMS is an open format, so there are a lot of games that can load BMS
maps. The most well known of them are Lunatic Rave 2 for Windows.
beatoraja, a cross-platform client, and the browser-based Bemuse are
also well known in games that use BMS as the main format.

## Setup

### Making your beatmap collection

For easy management, it is recommended to put all your beatmaps into a
single folder. When you download a beatmap (which is commonly in `.zip`
or `.rar`), open the file and drag the folder inside into your beatmap
folder.

### Using beatoraja

For people outside Japan, it is better to use beatoraja instead of LR2,
as the interface is friendlier.

beatoraja uses Java. A Java runtime is bundled in `beatoraja-jre-win64`,
but not in `beatoraja-modernchic`. If you have a working Java runtime
(the icon for `.jar` is a coffee cup or a humanlike figure), use the
latter; If not, it is better to download the former.

To make your collection playable, drag it into `BMS Path`, located at
the `Resource` tab. To play dans (introduced later), click `Load
difficulty table`.

### Using Lunatic Rave 2

Lunatic Rave 2 is started by opening `LR2.exe`. On the first time
starting it, you would (if you don't know Japanese and/or use a non-
Japanese computer) be greeted by a load of unreadable text. Here, click
`OK`, then create a new user by typing the username you want in `ID`
and make a password for it. Afterwards, and in the next dialog, click
`OK`. This would take you to the setup dialog.

To make your collection playable, drag it into the setup dialog, then
click `Yes`. Then, click the `Play` button at the bottomleft corner to
enjoy.

To make the setup dialog at least usable (for non-Japanese or on a
non-Japanese computer), set language to English.

### Using Bemuse

Bemuse is easy to use. Drag a beatmap into the Bemuse window, and you
can play it.

## Beatmaps

Most BMS beatmaps are released on events, where they are available for
download and play. If you are on time, you can also rate the beatmaps
yourself.

- [THE BMS OF FIGHTERS XVI -NEO DYSTOPIA-](https://manbow.nothing.sh/event/event.cgi?action=List_def&event=133)

Some people have collected beatmaps into packs. Packs provide an easy
access to lots of songs, some of which are no longer available at their
said download links.

## Grade (Dan) system

While there is no official grade system, the GENOSIDE system is widely
recognised throughout the community, covering beginners (1 dan) and
experts (various insane dans) alike.

- [LR2 internet ranking](http://www.dream-pro.info/~lavalse/LR2IR/search.cgi?mode=gradelist)

Most grade systems use ~~Chinese~~ Japanese names. Here is the
translation of dan names:

- 一段 1st Dan
- 二段 2nd Dan
- 三段 3rd Dan
- 四段 4th Dan
- 五段 5th Dan
- 六段 6th Dan
- 七段 7th Dan
- 八段 8th Dan
- 九段 9th Dan
- 十段 10th Dan
- 発狂一段 Insane 1st Dan, or 11th Dan, meant for high-level players
- 発狂十段 Insane 10th Dan, or 20th Dan
- 発狂皆伝 Insane Kaiden, for highest-level players; think Azimuth
- Overjoy for gods, think Zenith

Have fun!
