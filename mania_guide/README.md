McEndu's Guide to _osu!mania_ Mapping
=====================================

This is an attempt to introduce new people into mapping. Hopefully, by
making this guide, I am able to tell how one can make a good map and push
it to rank, and allow others to understand my mapping style.

This is only one point of view on mapping in _osu!mania_, as well as other
vertical-scrolling rhythm games like _Malody_ and _BMS_. If you want to
become unique, I highly recommend reading the guides or maps by other
mappers.

## To start

I assume that you know how to play _osu!_, at least able to navigate
through the menus and start a game.

At the main menu of _osu!_, click the _Edit_ button. Then, drag and drop
a `.mp3` file into the game. You would see a new song with an empty
title. You can also drop an `.osz` from the
[featured artist listing][fa].

After trying to play the song, you would be greeted with the song setup
screen. Navigate to the last tab (titled _Advanced_), then change _Allowed
Modes_ to _osu!mania_ &ndash; Without this you won't get the _osu!mania_
editor. Afterwards, go to the _Difficulty_ panel. You would see a new
slider named _Key Count_ ranging from 1 to 9. There is also a _Co-op_
checkbox beside it which doubles the key count. The ranking criteria
have restrictions on key counts:

> **Beatmaps can only use 4 to 9 keys.** Anything else is not supported
> for the Ranked section.

In this tutorial, maps with the same _Key Count_ value are referred to be
under a single **keymode**.

The most common keymodes in _osu!mania_ is 4 keys and 7 keys, abbreviated
commonly as 4K and 7K. Other keymodes do however have a niche community,
and there are beatmap nominators interested in seeing the rare keymodes
having a new ranked map.

Most of the examples in this guide are in 7K. It is because that 7K is
unique for both being common and flexible, while even though 4K is common,
its sheer key count makes the mode limited for conveying ideas.

## Importing Beatmaps

To checkout the examples in _osu!_, you can download a snapshot of this
repository here. Afterwards, navigate to `mania_guide/beatmaps`. In
_osu!_, press `Ctrl`+`O` and then click _Open osu! folder_. Navigate to
`Songs` in the new Explorer window, and drag and drop a folder from the
former directory into the latter. Hit `F5` to see the songs show up in
_osu!_ and available for inspection.
