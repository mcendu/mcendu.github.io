# Archive of rhythm game charts

This is an archive of my rhythm game charts. Most of these are links to
the official uploading site, although those that I don't want to upload
and those made for games without a central authority (e.g. BMS and
Stepmania) will rest in this site.

## VSRG

**Vertical Scrolling Rhythm Game**, often shortened as **VSRG**, is
one of the simplest types of rhythm game in mechanics. BMS-based
games, Stepmania, osu!mania and Malody Key are examples of VSRGs.

### 7K and 7K+1

- [無人区-Vacuum Track#ADD8E6-](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1151089)
  My first serious rank project. 7K+1 is done first completely on my own,
  with a 4K set added later due to input from a modder.

- [Sweet* Witch* Girl*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1401516)
- [MilK](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1443095) (WIP)
An experiment with LNs and an attempt to go outside my comfort zone.

### 4K

- [Halcyon](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1102270) (abandoned)
  My first upload on osu!. Being a piece of sh*t, it ended up gaining
  over a thousand plays for some reason&hellip;

- [`#1f1e33`](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1184620#mania/2485264)

- [The Last Page](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1272833)
- [777](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1312841) (abandoned)
  Made by stealing ideas from 666 of SDVX, ending up containing a large
  vibro section that makes it unrankable.
- Press S (abandoned; links below)
  - [EZ](http://m.mugzone.net/chart/89454)
  - [NM](http://m.mugzone.net/chart/90115)

    TV Size contest #2][ots2], in which I took part.
  - [MX](osu/serendipity_osu_aninande.osu) (hosted here, no audio)
    Made for the contest proper. Ended up at #5 (last place).

  - Easy (not yet ready)
    By luck, one of the contestants chose not to map, so I got a slot.
